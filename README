APACHE MOD_MACRO MODULE:
------------------------

This module allows to define and use macros in apache runtime
configuration files.

To install it, see the INSTALL file.

It has been tested with apache-2.2.0 on a Linux/Intel machine.
However it does only use some string processing thus it should be portable
at least on any UN*X machine.
